As a pet lover, I want to be able to browse a list of adoptable dogs so that I can find my perfect companion. As a pet owner, I want to be able to search for dogs by specific criteria (e.g., breed, size, gender) so that I can find a dog that fits my lifestyle and preferences. As a rescue organization worker, I want to be able to add new dogs to the list so that I can help more pets find homes. As a rescue organization worker, I want to be able to delete dogs from the list when they have been adopted so that the list remains up to date. As a rescue organization worker, I want to be able to update the details of a dog (e.g., if the dog's medical status changes) so that the information displayed to users is accurate.
